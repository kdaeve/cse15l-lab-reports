## <strong>Step 2: Remotely Connecting</strong><br/>
University provides specific course accounts for students. For this step, we'll use a command which calls <strong>ssh</strong>  

For Windows:  
Before we get started, you need to install OpenSSH to connect your server or other computers. To install OpenSSH, please visit [Microsoft Documentation website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) and following this instruction to install it.  
  
  For macOS/Linux:  
  Since these operate system is Unix based operating systems, they have ssh integration built in, so you don't need to do any extra steps.

## <strong>Step 4: Moving Files with scp</strong><br/>  
Alright, since we're able to remote connect the server. Now. it's a good time to learn how to copy files to the server with scp.  
Step 1: Change the directory to the file location on the terminal that you want to copy to the server.  

cd /your/file/directory  
Step 2: Use the follow command to copy your file to the server.  
scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/
